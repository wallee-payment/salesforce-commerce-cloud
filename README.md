# Salesforce Commerce Cloud Wallee Cartridge

Wallee provides LINK cartridges to integrate with Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC). These cartridges enable a SFRA storefront to use the Wallee payment service. These cartridges support SFRA version 4.x.x.

## Requirements

It is required to have an Wallee account to use these cartridges. Please signup [here](https://app-wallee.com/user/signup).
